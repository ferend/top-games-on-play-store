**Explotary Data Analysis and Algorithms for Top Games on Google Play Store**


## Project Explanation

With the dataset I acquired from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave/top-play-store-games), I explained the questions that many developers want to know before creating project plans and game types.

Questions such as target genre, play type, paid or freeâ€¦ To find answers to these questions we should analyze the user ratings given for the games. I must state that this analysis will be on the threshold of higher user rating and attraction will result in higher profit.

I addition I will apply different regression models to forecast what affects higher user ratings so that developers can come up with the most profitable and successful project for mobile game development.
